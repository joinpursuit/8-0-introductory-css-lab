    <div>
      <p>
        James Russell is a Full Stack Web Developer and Photographer born in Brooklyn, New York, where he was raised and spent a lot of time with his fatherâ€™s side of the family.  
        He was mainly raised by his loving grandmother during the day. When James became older he then returned the favor by spending and helping take care of his grandmother and 
        older family members who grew ill as time went on. He also lived in Tampa, 
        Florida for a few years where he also went to college for some time. After getting homesick James moved back to New York in order to be closer to family and find out his true passions. 
        He quickly learned that he had a real love for the arts. Things such as photography, music, painting, movies are things he loves to do and enjoy frequently. 
        He also enjoys sports, staying fit, hiking, traveling, mixed martial arts, eating delicious food and video games. After moving back to New York and trying various professions 
        he then began to explore his love for technology. The pandemic made his decision a lot more clear, he enrolled in a tech fellowship to pursue and explore what he thought he knew about technology and learn more of the direction the world is headed in.
